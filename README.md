# Analyzing-Ken-Jee-Data

## Project Overview 

* One of my favorite youtubers, Ken Jee recently released a youtube video in which he asks the community to analyze his youtube data to understand trends and unlock new insights. 

* With Ken being one of my favorite Data Science related youtubers, I decided to give it a shot and see what sorts of analysis I can make on his widely succesful youtube channel. 

* Attached below is a link to the youtube video along with a link to his kaggle page where the data was downloaded from:
